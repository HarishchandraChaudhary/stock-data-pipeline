A great `README.md` file is crucial for a technical assignment. It not only tells the user what your project does but also guides them on how to use it, proving that your solution is well-documented and professional.

Here is a comprehensive `README.md` file tailored for your Dockerized Data Pipeline project. You can copy this content and fill in the specifics for your own implementation.

### Dockerized Data Pipeline for Stock Market Analysis

This project is a containerized data pipeline built with **Docker Compose** and **Apache Airflow** (or **Dagster**) to automatically fetch, process, and store daily stock market data from a public API into a PostgreSQL database.

The pipeline is designed to be robust, scalable, and easy to deploy with a single command. It fulfills the requirements of the technical assessment by automating the entire data ingestion process.

-----

### Features

  * **Automated Data Fetching:** Automatically retrieves daily stock price data from the **Alpha Vantage API** on a scheduled basis.
  * **Data Orchestration:** The pipeline is orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**, which manages the workflow, dependencies, and scheduling of all tasks.
  * **Containerized Environment:** The entire stack, including the data orchestrator, PostgreSQL database, and Python scripts, is deployed using **Docker Compose**.
  * **Robust Error Handling:** The pipeline includes comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage API failures, network issues, and missing data points.
  * **Security:** Sensitive information like API keys and database credentials are managed securely using environment variables (`.env` file).
  * **Scalable Architecture:** The modular design allows for easy scaling to accommodate new data sources or increased data volume.

-----

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

  * **Docker:** `(version 20.10.0 or higher)`
  * **Docker Compose:** `(version 3.5 or higher)`

-----

### Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to set up and run the data pipeline.

#### 1\. Clone the Repository

First, clone this project from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarishchandraChaudhary/stock-data-pipeline
cd stock-data-pipeline
```

#### 2\. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will hold your sensitive credentials.

```
# Alpha Vantage API Key
STOCK_API_KEY=YOUR_ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY

# PostgreSQL Credentials
POSTGRES_USER=airflow
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=airflow
POSTGRES_DB=airflow
```

**Note:** You can obtain a free API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.alphavantage.co/support/%23api-key).

#### 3\. Run the Pipeline

With Docker and Docker Compose installed, start the entire pipeline using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

  * `up`: Starts all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
  * `--build`: Builds the Docker images from the provided `Dockerfile`s.
  * `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode, leaving your terminal free.

#### 4\. Access the Airflow UI

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the Airflow webserver to monitor the pipeline:

Open your web browser and navigate to:

`http://localhost:8080`

You will see the Airflow UI, where you can view your `stock_data_pipeline` DAG, trigger it manually, and inspect its logs and status.

### Pipeline Logic

The data pipeline is orchestrated by a single **Airflow DAG** (`stock_data_dag.py`) that performs the following steps:

1.  **API Interaction:** A Python script (`api_fetcher.py`) uses the `requests` library to connect to the Alpha Vantage API and retrieve daily stock data in JSON format.
2.  **Data Extraction:** The script parses the JSON response and extracts relevant data points (date, open, high, low, close, volume).
3.  **Database Update:** The extracted data is then used to update a designated PostgreSQL table (`daily_prices`). The logic uses `ON CONFLICT` to handle duplicate entries, ensuring that the database is always kept up-to-date without raising errors.

### Error Handling & Robustness

  * **API Failures:** The Python script uses `try-except` blocks and checks for `response.raise_for_status()` to catch common network or API-related errors. If the data fetch fails, the task will be marked as a failure in Airflow.
  * **Missing Data:** The script includes conditional logic to check if the expected data exists in the JSON response before attempting to parse it, preventing errors from malformed or incomplete data.
  * **Database Resilience:** The `ON CONFLICT` clause ensures that the database update process can be safely retried without failing on existing records, making the pipeline idempotent.

### Technologies Used

  * **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow
  * **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL
  * **Programming Language:** Python
  * **API:** Alpha Vantage
